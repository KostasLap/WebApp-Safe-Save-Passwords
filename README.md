# WebApp-Safe-Save-Passwords
My first try to create a "web-app" that helps you to keep your passwords safe.

App Description:

This app allows users to securely store their usernames and passwords. Here's how it works:

**1. Input Credentials:** Users enter their username and password into the app.

**2. Download Encrypted Password File:** When users click the "Submit" button, a text file is generated and downloaded to their computer. This file contains the original username and an encrypted version of the password.

**3. Store Safely:** Users can store this text file in a secure location on their computer or another safe storage medium.

**4. Retrieve Original Password:** If users need to access their original password, they can upload the text file back into the app using the "Choose File" area and then click the "Reverse Password" button.

**5. Display Credentials:** An alert will appear in the browser showing the username and the original (decrypted) password.


***My clarification:***
- It was my first try, and there is certainly room for improvement for this "web-app".

 **Tools for this project**:
